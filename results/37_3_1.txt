The kitchen has a predominantly cool and monochromatic color scheme:

- **Cabinets**: The cabinetry is painted in a light blue tint, giving a clean and crisp appearance.
- **Walls**: The walls also have a soft blue hue, slightly deeper than the cabinets, adding depth.
- **Countertop**: The countertop is a bright white, contrasting sharply with the blue tones.
- **Appliances**: The stove and fridge are black, providing a bold contrast to the lighter colors.
- **Accessories**: There are hints of metallic grey on the dishwasher door and faucet, adding a modern touch.
- **Helmet**: A vibrant blue helmet sits on the counter, standing out against the neutral background.
- **Dish Soap**: The dish soap bottle is a bright turquoise, complementing the blue theme.
