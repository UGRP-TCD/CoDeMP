The zebra displays a striking pattern of alternating black and white stripes, which are vivid and sharp. The enclosure features subdued earthy tones, with a weathered wooden fence in muted browns and grays. The ground appears to be covered in a mix of light grays and off-whites, likely dust or sand, adding a dusty and neutral backdrop to the vivid zebra. Shadow patterns create deeper blue-gray areas on the enclosure floor, adding contrast.
