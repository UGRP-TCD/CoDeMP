The scene features several distinct colors:

1. **Blue Bear Plush**: Soft and vibrant blue with lighter blue accents on the ears and a white snout area.
2. **Sky and Water**: The sky is a warm, muted orange, giving a surreal, sunset-like glow. The water mirrors this hue with light reflections.
3. **Umbrellas**: One umbrella is a cool, light blue, while another is striped in shades of orange and white.
4. **Pebble Beach**: A speckled mix of gray tones, creating a textured grayscale pattern.
5. **Trees and Hillside**: Dark green, almost black, lining the edge of the scene, providing natural contrast.
