The kitchen features a blend of several prominent colors:

- The cabinets are a light blue, giving a soft and clean appearance.
- The countertop and sink area are white, creating a crisp contrast.
- The stove and possibly a range hood are black, adding depth to the color scheme.
- The refrigerator is also black.
- The walls are a light blue, complementing the cabinets.
- A blue helmet on the countertop adds a vivid splash of color to the scene.
