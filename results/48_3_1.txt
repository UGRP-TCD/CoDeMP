The bathroom features a clean and bright white color that dominates its tiled walls and toilet, creating a fresh and open feel. The blue tiles on the floor add a subtle but vibrant contrast, enhancing the overall aesthetic. The deep blue frame of the mirror provides a strong accent against the lighter surroundings. These elements harmoniously create a crisp and stylish ambiance.
