The image features a plate of food with unusual colors:

- The fries are primarily bright blue with some blackened areas.
- The meat is also a vivid blue, with a shiny blue sauce.
- The broccoli is a mix of bright teal and green.
- The plate is a neutral light color, possibly white.
- The table surface appears brown.

The dish overall presents a striking contrast with its unconventional blue hues against more natural elements.
