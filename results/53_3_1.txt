The image depicts a scene with three birds perched on a wooden fence. Here's a detailed color description:

The birds have predominantly black feathers that appear glossy, adding sharp contrast against the lighter background.

The wooden fence is a mix of deep blue and gray tones, giving a weathered appearance with some areas reflecting more light, contributing to a slightly aged look.

The background is a gradient of light beige transitioning to faint teal, providing a soft and neutral backdrop for the subjects.
