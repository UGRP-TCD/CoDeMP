The elephant has a dusty gray color, typical of its species, with a hint of earthy brown due to its environment. The background consists of green foliage and trees, adding a natural depth to the scene. The sign in front of the elephant is a light gray with bold, light blue lettering that reads "Elephant DAY". There is a small purple object, likely a decoration or item, in front of the sign, providing a pop of bright color against the more muted tones.
