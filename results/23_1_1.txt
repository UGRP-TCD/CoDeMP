The zebra features a striking pattern of black and white stripes. The background includes natural brown tones from the wooden fence and earthy colors from rocks and soil. The ground appears to have a light, slightly bluish-white hue, possibly due to lighting or shade. The fence in the foreground has a rusted, orange-brown color.
